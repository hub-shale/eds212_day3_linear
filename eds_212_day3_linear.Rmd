### vectors / linear algebra in R

```{r}
# create a simple vector
vec_a = c(1, 6)
vec_b = c(2, 4)

vec_c = vec_a + vec_b 
# vector addition
vec_c

vec_d = 4 * (vec_b - vec_a)
# vector sultiplication and subtraction
vec_d
```


### Dot product 

%*% 

```{r}
cd_dot = vec_c %*% vec_d
cd_dot
```


### EOD activity, with $vec_a$ and $vec_b$ as the vectors described in part 2

```{r}
vec_a + vec_b
vec_b - vec_a
4 * vec_a
vec_a %*% vec_b
```
